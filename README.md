## Caution

Use this custom component responsibly and be aware of potential risks. There are no guarantees provided, and any misuse or incorrect implementation may result in undesirable outcomes. Ensure that your inverter is not compromised during communication.

  
## Known Limitations

**Update Frequency:** The library may experience limitations in fetching updates, potentially around twice per minute. The inverter firmware may enforce a mandatory wait period of approximately 30 seconds between requests.

**Compatibility:** While developed for the HMS-800W-T4 inverter, compatibility with other inverters from the series is untested at the time of writing. Exercise caution and conduct thorough testing if using with different inverter models.
